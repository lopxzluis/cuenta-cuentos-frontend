This Vue.js project is a simple web application that allows users to generate creative stories using the OpenAI API. The user enters a prompt or topic into a text input field, and upon submission, the app sends this prompt to OpenAI's language model (e.g., GPT-4) via an API call. The API responds with a generated story based on the user's input. The story is then displayed dynamically on the page.
